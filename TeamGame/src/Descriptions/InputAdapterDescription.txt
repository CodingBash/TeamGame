InputAdapter Class Description

/*
 * An input adapter object acts as the connection between keyboard/mouse and
 * the game objects. It receives the native OS keyboard events, and
 * distributes them to the screen object and the two player objects.
 * ScreenInterface defines the required methods for the screen - for now,
 * just a pause action and a quit action.
 * Controllable defines the methods that players/characters must implement.
